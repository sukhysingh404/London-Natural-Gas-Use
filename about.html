            This website is to showcase two maps I created with public datasets. London gas sales 2001 exists as a predecestor
            to the more informative London gas sales by year. This webpage exists entirely to allow me to host
            these maps on GitHub. </p>
            <p>
            The first map shows London's domestic gas sales per consumer by borough in the year 2001.
            The second map takes this a step further, showing how domestic gas sales have changed from 2001 to
            2021.
