            This website showcases two maps I created with public datasets. This project was driven out of curiosity after reading Dieter Helm's Burn Out. 
                I wanted to visualise how natural gas consumption has changed in my home city.</p>
            <p>
            The first map shows London's domestic gas sales per consumer by borough in the year 2001.
            The second map takes this a step further, showing how domestic gas sales have changed from 2001 to
            2021.
