This project details my progression in displaying London's domestic energy gas use by borough.

The first stage can be seen in the "London Natural Gas Use Static" notebook file. You can see a static choropleth map with a legend showing the mWhs from 2001-2021.

The next stage was the "London Natural Gas Use 2001" notebook. Here I utilised the Python Plotly library to build an interactive map of London's gas use by borough.

I took this a step further in the "London Natural Gas Use 21st Century" notebook. Here, the change in energy use can be observed by year.
